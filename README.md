SimpleStatus
============

This plugin offers players a very simple and easy way to update their current status so that other players on the server know what they are doing.

For example, players could use this plugin to communicate the following:

* Currently AFK
* Recording a video
* Busy caving, can't chat


## Commands

The following commands are available in this plugin:

### /status

This command allows you to view or set your status message. It can be shortened to **/st**.

* To view your current status, type **/status**
* To update your status, type **/status New Status Here**

### /clearstatus

This command clears your current status message. It can be abbreviated to **/clear**, **/cs** or **/back**.

### Shorthand commands for common statuses:

The plugin has some built-in shortcuts to set common status messages. These statuses are also displayed in different colours 
to distinguish them from user-set statuses.

* **/afk** - sets your status to "AFK"
* **/recording** or **/rec** - sets your status to "recording"
